title: Create an Azure Cloud-Account
---

Before you can start, you will need to create an _Azure_ account. If you not already have an account, sign up at [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com). But in fact, this should be somewhat cloud provider independent, so Google Cloud or AWS should work as well, though, I'm only describing the realy stuff for Azure for now.
