## Simple

You can work directly from your workstation. Make sure you have the following tools available:

* An editor suitable for coding, e.g. Atom, Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text
* [`az`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [`gradle`](https://gradle.org/install/)

On a Mac we recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install these tools, except for `Docker`, this needs to be installed directly from docker hub.

* [`Docker for MacOS`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [`Docker for Windows`](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
